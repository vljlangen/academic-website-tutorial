```

**Save the file** â†’ Check your browser â†’ See instant changes!

### Add Your Photo

1. **Save your professional headshot** as `content/authors/admin/avatar.jpg`
2. **Recommended**: 500x500 pixels, under 1MB
3. **Refresh browser** to see your photo

### Update Site Settings

Edit `config/_default/config.yaml`:

```yaml
title: 'Dr. Your Name - Academic Website'
baseURL: 'https://your-name.netlify.app'  # We'll set this up later
```

## Step 3: Explore and Customize

Your site has these main sections. Explore them by clicking around:

**Main Sections:**

- **Home**: Your bio and highlights
- **Publications**: Research papers (example content now)
- **Projects**: Research projects  
- **Teaching**: Course information
- **Contact**: Your contact details

### Quick Wins

**Remove demo content**: Delete any example files in:

- `content/publication/` (keep the `_index.md` file)
- `content/project/` (keep the `_index.md` file)

**Add your CV**: 

1. Save your CV as `static/uploads/cv.pdf`
2. It's now available at `http://localhost:1313/uploads/cv.pdf`

### Customize Homepage Widgets

Edit `content/_index.md` to show/hide sections:

```yaml
# To hide a section, add: 
demo: false

# To show a section, remove the demo line or set:
demo: true
```

## Step 4: Essential File Structure

Here's what you're working with:

```
my-academic-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authors/admin/           # Your profile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ publication/             # Your papers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project/                 # Your research
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _index.md               # Homepage layout
â”œâ”€â”€ static/uploads/              # CV, PDFs, files
â”œâ”€â”€ config/_default/             # Site settings
â””â”€â”€ hugo.toml                   # Main config
```

**Key principle**: 

- Content goes in `content/`
- Files (PDFs, images) go in `static/`
- Settings go in `config/`

## Step 5: Keep Experimenting

With `hugo server` running:

1. **Edit any file** â†’ **Save** â†’ **Check browser**
2. **Try different settings** in your profile
3. **Add content** to different sections
4. **Upload files** to `static/uploads/`

### Common Workflow:

```bash
# Start server (always)
hugo server

# Edit files in your text editor
# Save changes
# Check browser (auto-refreshes)
# Repeat
```

### Stop Server:

Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal when done.
