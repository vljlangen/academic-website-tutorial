# Save Your Work to GitHub

Time to save your website and put it on GitHub so you can deploy it to the internet.

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Click** the green "New" button on GitHub
2. **Repository name**: `my-academic-website` (or whatever you prefer)
3. **Make it Public** (required for free Netlify hosting)
4. **Don't check** "Add a README" (you already have one)
5. **Click** "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Site to GitHub

Copy the commands GitHub shows you, but here's what you'll run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in your website directory
cd ~/websites/my-academic-site

# Add your changes
git add .
git commit -m "My academic website setup"

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-academic-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace** `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Basic Git Workflow

Now you have a simple workflow for updating your website:

```bash
# After making changes to your site:

# 1. Save all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Updated my bio and added new publication"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push
```

**That's it!** Three commands to save and sync your website.

## Common Git Commands

Here are the only Git commands you need:

```bash
# See what's changed
git status

# Save changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"

# Send to GitHub
git push

# Get latest from GitHub (if editing from multiple computers)
git pull
```

## When Things Go Wrong

**Can't push?** Try:
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

**Made a mistake?** Don't worry:

- GitHub keeps all your old versions
- You can always go back
- Your local files are safe

## Why GitHub?

**For your website:**

- **Free hosting** for your code
- **Version history** - see all your changes
- **Backup** - your site is safe in the cloud
- **Required** for Netlify deployment

**For your research:**

- Share code and data
- Collaborate with others
- Professional presence
- Industry standard

## Check Your Work

Your website code should now be visible at:

`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-academic-website`

You should see all your files there, including:

- `content/` folder with your profile
- `config/` folder with settings
- All the template files

## Next Step

Perfect! Your website is now saved on GitHub. 

In the next chapter, we'll deploy it to the internet so anyone can visit your professional academic website.
