No additional installation needed. 2.1.2 Windows Download and install from git-scm.com Important: During installation, select ‚ÄúGit Bash‚Äù for command line access. 2.1.3 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) sudo apt update sudo apt install git 2.1.4 Verify Git Installation git --version # Should show: git version 2.x.x 2.2 Step 2: Install Hugo Extended Hugo builds your website. You need the extended version. 2.2.1 macOS # Using Homebrew brew install hugo 2.2.2 Windows Using Chocolatey (install Chocolatey first from chocolatey.org): choco install hugo-extended Or download directly from Hugo releases - get the ‚Äúextended‚Äù version. 2.2.3 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) # Install extended version sudo apt install hugo # Or download from GitHub releases for latest version 2.2.4 Verify Hugo Installation hugo version # Should show: hugo v0.119.0+extended (includes &quot;extended&quot;) Important: Must include ‚Äúextended‚Äù in the output. 2.3 Step 3: Choose Your Editor 2.3.1 VS Code (Recommended for Beginners) Free and feature-rich Excellent Markdown support Git integration Extensions for Hugo development Download: code.visualstudio.com 2.3.2 Cursor AI (AI-Powered Coding) VS Code fork with AI assistance Built-in AI code completion and chat Excellent for learning and productivity Hugo and Markdown support Download: cursor.sh 2.3.3 RStudio (If You Use R) Excellent for R Markdown integration Good Markdown support Built-in Git interface Download: rstudio.com 2.3.4 Quick VS Code Setup If you chose VS Code, install these extensions: Open VS Code Click Extensions icon (squares in sidebar) Install: ‚ÄúHugo Language and Syntax Support‚Äù Install: ‚ÄúMarkdown All in One‚Äù 2.4 Step 4: Git Configuration &amp; Authentication 2.4.1 Basic Identity Setup Set your identity for Git: git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot; git config --global user.email &quot;your.email@university.edu&quot; 2.4.2 GitHub Account Setup First, create your GitHub account (if you don‚Äôt have one): Go to github.com Sign up for a free account Choose a username (this will be part of your website URL) 2.4.3 GitHub Authentication (Required) GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of passwords for Git operations. Create your PAT: https://github.com/settings/tokens üí° Note: If you choose the R approach below, usethis::create_github_token() will open this page for you automatically. 2.4.4 macOS Authentication Setup Option 1: R + RStudio + usethis + gitcreds Best for R users: # In R or RStudio: install.packages(c(&quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;gitcreds&quot;)) usethis::create_github_token() # Opens browser to create PAT gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # Enter your PAT when prompted Option 2: Git CLI + macOS Keychain Best for command-line Git users: # Enable secure credential storage git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain üìå This ensures your PAT is stored in the macOS Keychain and reused silently. When you clone or push, you‚Äôll be asked for: Username: your_github_username Password: your_PAT_here ‚úÖ Git will remember the token after this ‚Äî no need to reenter. 2.4.5 Windows Authentication Setup Option 1: R + RStudio + usethis + gitcreds Best for R users ‚Äî identical process as on macOS: # In R or RStudio: install.packages(c(&quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;gitcreds&quot;)) usethis::create_github_token() # Opens browser to create PAT gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # Enter your PAT when prompted Option 2: Git CLI + Windows Credential Manager Best for command-line Git users: # Set the credential helper git config --global credential.helper manager-core üí° This tells Git to use Git Credential Manager (GCM), which stores credentials securely in Windows Credential Manager. When you clone or push, you‚Äôll be asked for: Username: your_github_username Password: your_PAT_here ‚úÖ Git will remember the token after this ‚Äî no need to reenter. 2.5 Ready!
