You’ll install three essential tools: Git for version control, Hugo for building your website, and choose a code editor. We’ll make sure everything works together before moving on to clone your website template. "],["essential-setup.html", "Chapter 2 Essential Setup 2.1 Step 1: Install Git 2.2 Step 2: Install Go 2.3 Step 3: Install Hugo Extended 2.4 Step 4: Choose Your Editor 2.5 Step 5: Git Configuration &amp; Authentication 2.6 Ready!", " Chapter 2 Essential Setup Image credit: Pexels Install three tools and you’re ready to go: Git - Save and sync your website Hugo (and Go) - Build your website Editor - Edit your content 2.1 Step 1: Install Git 2.1.1 macOS Git is already installed on your Mac! No additional installation needed. 2.1.2 Windows Download and install from git-scm.com Important: During installation, select “Git Bash” for command line access. 2.1.3 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) sudo apt update sudo apt install git 2.1.4 Verify Git Installation git --version # Should show: git version 2.x.x 2.2 Step 2: Install Go Hugo requires Go for modules and certain features. Install the latest version. 2.2.1 macOS # Using Homebrew brew install go 2.2.2 Windows Download and install from golang.org/dl - get the latest version. 2.2.3 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) # Install latest Go sudo apt update sudo apt install golang-go # Or download latest version from golang.org/dl for most recent release 2.2.4 Verify Go Installation go version # Should show: go version go1.21.x (or newer) 2.3 Step 3: Install Hugo Extended Hugo builds your website. You need the extended version. ⚠️ Important: The Hugo version must match your template’s requirements. 2.3.1 Step 3.1: Check Required Hugo Version Before installing Hugo, check the version required by the Academic CV template: Visit the template repository: Hugo Blox Academic CV Open the netlify.toml file in the repository Look for the line: HUGO_VERSION = \"0.xxx.x\" Note this version number - you’ll install this exact version 💡 Why this matters: Hugo Blox templates are tested with specific Hugo versions. Using a different version may cause build errors or missing features. 2.3.2 Step 3.2: Install the Correct Hugo Version Replace 0.xxx.x below with the version from netlify.toml: 2.3.3 macOS # Using Homebrew - install specific version brew install hugo@0.xxx.x # Or download specific version directly wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.xxx.x/hugo_extended_0.xxx.x_macOS-64bit.tar.gz 2.3.4 Windows Using Chocolatey (install Chocolatey first from chocolatey.org): choco install hugo-extended --version 0.xxx.x Or download directly from Hugo releases - get the “extended” version matching your template’s requirements. 2.3.5 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) # Download specific version from GitHub releases wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.xxx.x/hugo_extended_0.xxx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz tar -xzf hugo_extended_0.xxx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/ 2.3.6 Verify Hugo and Go Installation Before proceeding, make sure both Hugo and Go are accessible in your terminal: # Check Hugo is found and working hugo version # Should show: hugo v0.xxx.x+extended (matching your template&#39;s version) # Check Go is found and working go version # Should show: go version go1.21.x or newer Important: Hugo version must match your template’s requirements AND include “extended” in the output. If either command fails (“command not found”): First, restart your terminal (close and reopen terminal window) Check if tools are installed but not in PATH: # Find where Hugo is installed which hugo # Or try: whereis hugo (Linux) or where hugo (Windows) # Find where Go is installed which go # Or try: whereis go (Linux) or where go (Windows) If tools are found, add to PATH: macOS/Linux - Add these lines to your shell config file: # For Bash users (edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile) echo &#39;export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc # For Zsh users (edit ~/.zshrc) echo &#39;export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc # If you installed with Homebrew echo &#39;export PATH=&quot;/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc # Then reload your shell source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc Windows Add to system PATH: Search “Environment Variables” in Start menu Click “Environment Variables” Find “Path” in System Variables Add the folder containing hugo.exe and go.exe Still not working? Re-run the installation steps above 2.4 Step 4: Choose Your Editor 2.4.1 VS Code (Recommended for Beginners) Free and feature-rich Excellent Markdown support Git integration Extensions for Hugo development GitHub Copilot available - provides AI code suggestions and explanations, but cannot edit files directly Download: code.visualstudio.com Quick VS Code Setup: If you chose VS Code, install these extensions: Open VS Code Click Extensions icon (squares in sidebar) Install: “Hugo Language and Syntax Support” Install: “Markdown All in One” 2.4.2 Cursor AI (AI-Powered Coding) VS Code fork with AI assistance Built-in AI code completion and chat Excels at direct file editing - AI can modify your files directly through natural language commands Excellent for learning and productivity Hugo and Markdown support Free tier available - 2000 completions and 50 slow premium requests per month (resets every 30 days - usable for free indefinitely), then $20/month for unlimited usage Download: cursor.sh Setup: Same extensions as VS Code (Hugo Language and Syntax Support, Markdown All in One) 2.4.3 RStudio (If You Use R) Excellent for R Markdown integration Good Markdown support Built-in Git interface Completely free for individual use Download: rstudio.com 2.5 Step 5: Git Configuration &amp; Authentication 2.5.1 Basic Identity Setup Set your identity for Git: git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot; git config --global user.email &quot;your.email@university.edu&quot; 2.5.2 GitHub Account Setup First, create your GitHub account (if you don’t have one): Go to github.com Sign up for a free account Choose a username (this will be part of your website URL) 2.5.3 GitHub Authentication (Required) GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of passwords for Git operations. Create your PAT: https://github.com/settings/tokens 💡 Note: If you choose the R approach below, usethis::create_github_token() will open this page for you automatically. 2.5.4 macOS Authentication Setup Option 1: R + RStudio + usethis + gitcreds Best for R users: # In R or RStudio: install.packages(c(&quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;gitcreds&quot;)) usethis::create_github_token() # Opens browser to create PAT gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # Enter your PAT when prompted Option 2: Git CLI + macOS Keychain Best for command-line Git users: # Enable secure credential storage git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain 📌 This ensures your PAT is stored in the macOS Keychain and reused silently. When you clone or push, you’ll be asked for: Username: your_github_username Password: your_PAT_here ✅ Git will remember the token after this — no need to reenter. 2.5.5 Windows Authentication Setup Option 1: R + RStudio + usethis + gitcreds Best for R users — identical process as on macOS: # In R or RStudio: install.packages(c(&quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;gitcreds&quot;)) usethis::create_github_token() # Opens browser to create PAT gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # Enter your PAT when prompted Option 2: Git CLI + Windows Credential Manager Best for command-line Git users: # Set the credential helper git config --global credential.helper manager-core 💡 This tells Git to use Git Credential Manager (GCM), which stores credentials securely in Windows Credential Manager. When you clone or push, you’ll be asked for: Username: your_github_username Password: your_PAT_here ✅ Git will remember the token after this — no need to reenter. 2.6 Ready! You now have everything needed to build your academic website. What you have: ✅ Git - configured with GitHub authentication ✅ Go - required for Hugo modules and features ✅ Hugo Extended - for building your site (version-matched to template) ✅ Text Editor - for editing content Next Chapter Preview: Clone the academic template and start customizing!
